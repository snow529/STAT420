# Introduction

This has been a rough time for everyone due to the situation regarding the pandemic. Since late January, the coronavirus has been ravaging throughout the world and hitting every country with unpleasant surprises. Nations around the world have taken extreme measure to prevent the further spread of the virus and US is no exception. 

Since the end of March, Illinois state government has issued stay at home order which, according to the most recent new, may well extended into June(NBC Chicago, 2020). The good news is that our univeristy has the situation under control by implement multiple measures. By migrating classes and possible works online, plus spending extra resource on a smoother transition, students are able to take attend the university normally and safely without too much disruption and some classes even introduced noticible new policies to compensate for the mental states of the students.

But another possible problem slowly surfaces due to this pandemic. Because students no longer need to go to the classroom and most public facilities have been temporary closed, with the addition fact that people are encouraged to order food delivery, it is very hard for someone to stay fit during this lockdown. Currently, students have comparably more factors to grow weight instead of loosing weight. For students who are prone to binge eating and who have problem adapt to this new online structure, the possibility of getting obese from this pandemic becomes rather significant. 

As shown by the data from WHO("Global health risks", 2015), overweight and obesity are the fifth leading risk for global deaths. Since making everyone to not eat too much during this trying time is almost impossible, the only way to approach this problem is to look at the physical condition that a person already has. This is the primary reason that our group decided to pick the fat dataset--we want to study the effect of all possible physical condition factors and their effects on the body fat percentage. This goal to find the best model that can predict the body fat percentage of an individual based on body measurements. By have this model for the body fat percentage, we hope that we should be able to determine what kind of person is at the most risk of becoming obese base on his/hers current physical condition. 

This dataset contains the measurements of 252 men that include their density determined from underwater weighing, percent body fat using Siri's (1956) equation, age (in years), weight (in pounds), height (in inches), as well as their neck, chest, abdomen, hip, thigh, knee, ankle, bicep, forearm, and wrist circumference (in cm). This dataset can be found at: http://staff.pubhealth.ku.dk/~tag/Teaching/share/data/Bodyfat.html

# Methods
First, we are going to use forward, backward, and stepwise method to find the model with the smallest AIC and BIC.
```{r, echo = T, results = 'hide'}
fat <- read.csv("Bodyfat.csv")

#Backwards 
modelALL = lm(bodyfat ~ ., data = fat)
backwardsAIC = step(modelALL, direction = "backward") #Picks model with predictors Density Age and Chest #AIC = 120.84
N = length(resid(modelALL))
backwardsBIC = step(modelALL, direction = "backward", k = log(N)) #Picks Density and Chest #BIC= 133.3
```
The backward AIC method picks the model with Density, Age, and Chest as the model with the smallest AIC (120.84).  
The backward BIC method picks the model with Density and Chest as the as the model with the smallest BIC (133.3).

```{r, echo = T, results = 'hide'}
#Forward
modelstart = lm(bodyfat ~ 1, data = fat)
forwardAIC = step(modelstart, scope = bodyfat ~ Density + Age + Weight + Height + Neck + Chest + Abdomen + Hip + Thigh + Knee + Ankle + Biceps + Forearm, direction = "forward") #Chooses model with parameters Density Abdomen and Age #AIC = 120.04
forwardBIC = step(modelstart, scope = bodyfat ~ Density + Age + Weight + Height + Neck + Chest + Abdomen + Hip + Thigh + Knee + Ankle + Biceps + Forearm, direction = "forward", k = log(N)) #Chooses model with parameters Density and Abdomen #BIC = 131.99
```
The forward AIC method picks the model with Density, Abdomen, and Age as the model with the smallest AIC (120.04).  
The forward BIC method picks the model with Density and Abdomen as the as the model with the smallest BIC (131.99).

```{r, echo = T, results = 'hide'}
#Stepwise 
stepAIC = step(modelstart, scope = bodyfat ~ Density + Age + Weight + Height + Neck + Chest + Abdomen + Hip + Thigh + Knee + Ankle + Biceps + Forearm, direction = "both") #Model includes predictors Density, Age, Abdomen AIC = 120.04
stepBIC = step(modelstart, scope = bodyfat ~ Density + Age + Weight + Height + Neck + Chest + Abdomen + Hip + Thigh + Knee + Ankle + Biceps + Forearm, direction = "both", k = log(N)) #Density and Abdomen BIC = 131.99
```
The stepwise AIC method picks the model with Density, Abdomen, and Age as the model with the smallest AIC (120.04).  
The stepwise BIC method picks the model with Density and Abdomen as the as the model with the smallest BIC (131.99).

```{r}
#Exhaustive
library(leaps)
all_fat_mod = summary(regsubsets(bodyfat ~ ., data = fat))
p = length(coef(modelALL))
n = length(resid(modelALL))
fat_mod_aic = n * log(all_fat_mod$rss / n) + 2 * (2:p)
best_fat_ind = which.min(fat_mod_aic)
all_fat_mod$which[best_fat_ind,]
fat_mod_best_aic = lm(bodyfat ~ Density + Age + Abdomen, data = fat) #AIC = 120.0427

fat_mod_bic = n * log(all_fat_mod$rss / n) + log(n) * (2:p)
best_fat_bic = which.min(fat_mod_bic)
all_fat_mod$which[best_fat_bic,] #Density, Abdomen 
fat_mod_best_Bic = lm(bodyfat ~ Density + Abdomen, data = fat) 
extractAIC(fat_mod_best_Bic, k = log(n)) #BIC = 131.9893
```

From the methods that we used, we found that these 4 models have the lowest AIC and BIC:
```{r}
#models to consider
Model_DAC = lm(bodyfat ~ Density + Age + Chest, data = fat) #AIC Selection
Model_DC = lm(bodyfat ~ Density + Chest, data = fat) #BIC selection
Model_DAA = lm(bodyfat ~ Density + Age + Abdomen, data = fat) #AIC Selection
Model_DA = lm(bodyfat ~ Density + Abdomen, data = fat) #BIC Selection
```

```{r}
#BIC - picks smaller models
extractAIC(Model_DAC, k = log(n)) #134.9566 last #AIC Selection
extractAIC(Model_DC, k = log(n)) #133.3018 second #BIC Selection
extractAIC(Model_DAA, k = log(n)) #134.1604 third #AIC Selection
extractAIC(Model_DA, k = log(n)) #131.9893 best #BIC Selection

#AIC - picks larger models
extractAIC(Model_DAC) #120.8389 second #AIC Selection
extractAIC(Model_DC) #122.7135 last #BIC Selection
extractAIC(Model_DAA) #120.0427 best #AIC Selection
extractAIC(Model_DA) #121.401 third #BIC Selection
```

Now, we are going to compare the RMSE of these 4 models.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#RMSE
RMSE = function(test)
{sqrt((summary(test)$sigma^2)*test$df.residual/length(test$fitted.values))}

RMSE_DAC = RMSE(Model_DAC) #1.250929
RMSE_DAA = RMSE(Model_DAA) #1.248955
RMSE_DA = RMSE(Model_DA) #1.257305
RMSE_DC = RMSE(Model_DC) #1.260583
rbind(c("RMSE_DAC", "RMSE_DAA", "RMSE_DA", "RMSE_DC"), c(RMSE_DAC, RMSE_DAA, RMSE_DA, RMSE_DC))
```

Using the ANOVA test, we can see that Age is not significant at 0.05 but significant ar 0.07.
```{r}
#anova 
anova(Model_DA,Model_DAA) #not significant at 5 percent - significant at 7
```

Now, let's check whether or not our models meet the Normality and Constant Variance Assumptions.
Normality Assumption Test
```{r, echo=FALSE}
shapiro.test(resid(Model_DAA))$p.value
shapiro.test(resid(Model_DA))$p.value
```
Constant Variance Assumption Test
```{r}
bptest(Model_DAA)$p.value
bptest(Model_DA)$p.value
```
In appears that both models don't meet the Normality and Constant Variance assumptions (p-value is very small).

# Results

*Model_DAA*
RSE = 1.259
RMSE = 1.248955
R^2 = .9776
Adjusted R^2 = .9774

*Model_DAC*
RSE = 1.261
RMSE = 1.250929
R^2 = .9776
Adjusted R^2 = .9773

*Model_DC*
RSE = 1.268
RMSE = 1.260583
R^2 = .9772
Adjusted R^2 = .9770

*Model_DA*
RSE = 1.265
RMSE = 1.257305
R^2 = .9773
Adjusted R^2 = .9772

Given the intent of backward, forward, stepwise, and exhaustive selection procedures seek to find models with the smallest respective AIC and BIC values, we will omit the higher AIC and BIC models. 

This leaves us with `Model_DAA` (AIC) and `Model_DA`(BIC) to consider. 
In terms of testing, both models don't meet the Normality and Constant Variance assumption making them inadequate in being explanatory. In terms of anova testing, there is not a significant difference between models at a .05 significance level but there is a significant difference at .10. In terms of T tests for individual predictors of a model, the predictor Age in `Model_DAA` would reject the null (proving linearity) at a .10 significance but accepts the null at .05. Based off the rather dynamic nature of test results from change of significance, we will base our final decision on measures of error and variance of each model. 

# Conclusion

The best model to predict is `Model_DAA`. This model consists of the predictors Density, Age, and Abdomen Circumfrence. It has less error associated with it due to lower RSE and RMSE values It also has higher R^2 and adjusted R^2 values than `Model_DA`, meaning 97.76% of variance observed in the explanatory variable of selected model is described by the model.

Although the data used was not normal, we believe this represents the best model possible to make a prediction on body fat given these data points. Our analysis above clearly shows the benefit of this model over similar models, as well as the accuracy with which this model manages to predict.
